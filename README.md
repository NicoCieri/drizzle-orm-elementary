# Drizzle ORM Introductory Project

This repository contains a project I created while taking an introductory course on Drizzle ORM. The course was designed to teach the basics of Drizzle ORM, a modern and flexible ORM known for its exceptional developer experience, powerful tools, and outstanding performance.

## About This Project

This project is a practical implementation of the concepts learned throughout the course. It includes:

- **Neon**: Used as the PostgreSQL database platform for managing and hosting the database.
- **Schema Definitions**: TypeScript schemas that model the database structure.
- **Migration Files**: SQL migration files generated from the schemas.
- **SQL-like Queries Examples**: Writing TypeScript code that mirrors SQL syntax.
- **Relational Query Examples**: Demonstrations of object mapping for relational data.
- **Dynamic and Conditional Queries**: Building queries with conditional parameters.
- **Introspecting**: Generating schemas from existing databases.

## Conclusion

Taking this course provided me with a solid foundation in Drizzle ORM, and Iâ€™m excited to apply this knowledge in future web development projects. This repository serves as a reference for the basics of Drizzle ORM and how it can be implemented.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
